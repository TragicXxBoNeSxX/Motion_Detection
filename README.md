# Motion Detection
Motion Detection Scripts tested in Python 3.6-3.11. Capture is done using OpenCV, image filtering can be done with DLib, OpenCV or both.

Using the default webcam/video capture this will detect motion and save images with datetime as name for everytime the script detects motion in the live video capture.

The motiondetect_0.0.1.py can be run as a standalone since the filter images code was added into the main file, the Motion_Filter scripts are only needed for version 0.0.0
